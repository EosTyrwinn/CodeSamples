Documentation

How it meets the requirements:
	Overall Theme/Impact
		- The app is a lot of fun to screw around with and I wasted way to much time messing around with all the controls
		- The multiple origin points is uniqie and even more fun to mess with
	User Experience
		- The app is clear and self explanitory
		- No errors are thrown
		- Multiple controls of varying types are availible
		- Appearance is not ugly (I wish I could make it look good but I can't even make myself look good)
	Media
		- CSS passes validation
		- The only thing in the HTML that doesn't validate is the link from google fonts for custom fonts which I can't really control
		- Imbedded font exists (see above)
		- Canvas is used along with the save and restore features for every circle drawn
		- All CSS is external
	Code
		- all-code-files-named-like-this
		- JS coding standards are followed (I wouldn't be able to look at my own code otherwise)
		- Custom library is there with helper functions in it
		
What went right/wrong
	Most stuff went pretty well. My main issues came in trying to reference the radio buttons as a whole but I eventually figured it out.
	I also encountered issues with my reset function but most of that stemed from the fact that I couldn't get it in the library because I can't
	pass by reference in JS.
	
Non-course resources
	- None
	
Grade:
	- ~85%
	- I feel like my project isn't anything special. It's cool to play with and fun for a bit. It's something I could
	put in a portfolio but it just doesn't feel amazing to me.
