# CodeSamples
Here are some samples of my code. Each project should be able to be downloaded and run. Feel free to take a look around them. Each project also has an image called `_SampleCode` if you'd like a quick look at the good stuff.

### Atlas of American Languages
This project displays georgraphic information about the number of speakers of different languages in the US. It was focusing on using two different APIs in conjunction with each other.

### Gravity Snake
This project was a game that was simlar to the game snake but with physics and gravity involved so you were constantly falling back to the bottom of the screen.
- Language: C++
- Sample: Collision between the player and their goal
- Link: No live version

### Phyllotaxis
Phyllotaxis refers to the spiral arrangement of leaves on a plant. Here I was using graphics to let you play around with the different factors in the arrangement of those spirals to create cool images.
- Languiage: Javascript
- Sample: Calulating where to place the next dot in the spiral and drawing it

### Slider
Slider is a web game I made where you movement is done after you've released the button so that they player needs to commit to their movement even though they don't know exactly how far they'll move.
- Language: Javascript
- Sample: How I handled movement after the key was released and tracked the time it was held for
