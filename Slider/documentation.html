    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        How did I meet the requirements? Well starting with the file structure, I think that should be fairly 
        obvious if you look at it. As for the file content, the index page had a brief, catchy description of 
        the game and one of my concept images. The proposal page has all the parts of the game treatment that 
        were in the provided document and they were all formatted through Markup which can be found on my Git. 
        The documentation page… well just look here. The project page also meets requirements by virtue of its 
        existence and following the same general look and feel of the rest of the project. As for following the 
        design requirements, I designed and styled it myself from scratch the best I could and while it might 
        not look amazing, it doesn’t really violate any principals of design, it could just do them better.
