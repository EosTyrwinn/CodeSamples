    <h2>Game Concept</h2>
        <p>
            A maze-like puzzle game where you must avoid obstacles as you move through. 
            The catch? You don’t actually move until you release the key leaving you 
            blindly guessing how far you’ll go.
        </p>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
        <p>
            Slider is a maze/puzzle game in which you have to navigate a maze without running into any obstacles.
        </p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>
            Slider will be a desktop only game. There exists the possibility of making it 
            mobile friendly as well however that is not the initial target.
        </p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            There is not story in Slider. Its abstract style and simple premise leaves it 
            only giving the player the goal of making it to the end of the level.
        </p>
    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>
            The style of Slider will be very abstract (and only partially because I lack 
            any artistic skill). The character and obstacles will consist of simply colored 
            uniform shapes and the walls of the level will be very plain as well.
        </p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            The player must navigate their way through a maze without running into any obstacles. 
            However, they cannot see how far they are moving until the key is released meaning they 
            will have to estimate where they’ll end up. They player must reach the end before they use up all their lives.

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Alex Herman and I'm a second year Game Design and Development student at RIT. 
            My skills in coding are mostly in C# and Java. I'm also proficient in several programs 
            such as Photoshop, Maya, and Unity. My interests are all over the place from languages, 
            to science, to history and everywhere in between. Games happen to be a decent way for me 
            to combine all, or at least most, of my interests.
